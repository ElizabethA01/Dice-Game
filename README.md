## General Information
- The purpose of the project was to develop my skills building a game from scratch and using the coding languages JS specifically DOM, HTML and CSS as part of the course. 
- I undertook the project as part of a course I undertook, however I developed the project further by adding a button that refreshes the game. 


## Technologies Used
- JavaScript (DOM) - version ES6 
- HTML - version 5.0
- CSS - version 3.0


## Features
- Simple game that only requires user to press roll.

## My Thoughts
I really enjoyed creating the dice game, as I enjoy gaming. It was enjoyable to build the game from scratch and learning how to code in the Web Development course. For this project, I learnt how to use the API for HTML documents called Document Object Model (DOM) to create a website and to reference a JS function in HTML file.
