# Dice-Game

I created a game that uses HTML, CSS, Javascript with DOM to randomly roll 2 dices and it tells you the winner. 

This was initally from the course "Complete Web Developer Bootcamp", however I improved it by adding a button that refreshes a game. 

I'm looking into amending the number of players as well soon. 

# To Play

You simply press the button "Roll again" to roll the dice and the game will tell you the winner.
